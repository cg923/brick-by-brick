# Brick By Brick

Brick By Brick is an interactive web experience where users discover the threads of an emotional story by digging through emails and documents in a simulated operating system.

The story is a true one, told incidentally by actual e-mails I have sent and received.  It is the story of coming out as transgender and navigating the familial complications that came with it.
